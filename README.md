# Spatial Modeling of Hydrological Deficit Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the datasets, scripts, and outputs used in the study:

"Spatial modeling of hydrological deficit using machine learning and climatic data (1960–2024) in Northwestern Mexico."

The objective of this project is to analyze and model the spatial distribution of hydrological deficit using climatic data and machine learning techniques.

------------------------------------------------------------

STUDY AREA

The study area corresponds to northwestern Mexico and includes the following states:

-  Sonora
-  Sinaloa
-  Baja California
-  Baja California Sur

These regions are characterized by arid and semi-arid climates with low precipitation and high potential evapotranspiration.

------------------------------------------------------------

DATA SOURCES

The analysis uses the following climatic variables:

-  Precipitation (PR)
-  Potential Evapotranspiration (ETP)

Data sources:

-  TerraClimate dataset
-  Geographic data from INEGI and CONABIO

Spatial resolution: approximately 4 km  
Temporal coverage: 1960–2024

------------------------------------------------------------

METHODOLOGICAL WORKFLOW

The workflow implemented in this repository includes the following steps:

1. Climate data preprocessing
2. Water balance calculation
3. Hydrological deficit identification
4. Dataset construction
5. Machine learning model training
6. Model evaluation
7. SHAP interpretability analysis
8. Spatial prediction of hydrological deficit probability

------------------------------------------------------------

MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

Two machine learning algorithms were used:

-  Random Forest (RF)
-  Gradient Boosting (GB)

Model performance was evaluated using:

-  RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
-  MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
-  R² (Coefficient of Determination)

------------------------------------------------------------

MAIN OUTPUTS

The repository includes the following spatial outputs:

-  PR_mean.tif
-  ETP_mean.tif
-  WB_mean.tif
-  HD_probability.tif
-  HD_frequency.tif

These layers represent the spatial distribution of climatic conditions and hydrological deficit probability across northwestern Mexico.

SPATIAL RESULTS

The following figures illustrate the main spatial patterns derived from the analysis.

### Precipitation (1960 vs 2024)

![Precipitation comparison](Figures/precipitation_1960_2024.jpg)

These maps show the spatial distribution of precipitation across northwestern Mexico. Higher precipitation occurs mainly in the Sierra Madre Occidental, while the Baja California Peninsula and coastal regions present lower precipitation levels.

### Potential Evapotranspiration (1960 vs 2024)

![ETP comparison](Figures/etp_1960_2024.jpg)

Potential evapotranspiration shows an inverse spatial pattern relative to precipitation, with higher values in desert regions and lower values in mountainous areas.

### Climatic Means (1960–2024)

![Climatic means](Figures/climatic_means.jpg)

The mean climatic conditions reveal strong spatial contrasts between arid coastal regions and more humid mountainous zones.

### Water Balance

![Water balance comparison](Figures/water_balance_1960_2024.jpg)

Water balance results indicate widespread hydrological deficit across the region, particularly in Baja California and Sonora. More balanced conditions occur along the Sierra Madre Occidental.

### Hydrological Deficit Frequency and Model Prediction

![Deficit frequency and probability](Figures/deficit_frequency_probability.jpg)

Both the historical frequency and the predicted probability maps highlight the persistence of hydrological deficit across northwestern Mexico. The similarity between both maps indicates that the machine learning models successfully capture the underlying hydroclimatic patterns governing deficit occurrence.
